# Flight-Ticket-Price-Prediction-ML-Model
An ML model that predicts flight prices based on factors like source, destination, travel date, airline, and duration. It helps travelers find the best deals by forecasting price trends, enabling smarter booking decisions and cost savings
Project Showcase: Flight Price Prediction for Metro Cities ✈️

In today’s fast-paced travel industry, predicting flight prices can help travelers plan better and save money. To address this, I developed a machine learning model that predicts flight ticket prices for major metro cities.

🔍 Key Highlights:

Dataset: Cleaned and preprocessed flight data with features like airline, source, destination, departure time, and number of stops.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

ML Models Used:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regression

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed outliers, and performed feature engineering for better predictions.

Challenges:

Handling inconsistent or missing data

Dealing with outliers and skewed distributions

Converting categorical variables to numerical formats for ML models

Results:

Achieved 81.8% accuracy using Random Forest Regression

Provided reliable predictions to help travelers and airline analysts

💡 Real-World Application:
This model can be used by travel agencies or flight booking platforms to predict ticket prices dynamically, helping users make informed decisions.

📌 Skills Demonstrated:
Data Cleaning, Outlier Removal, Feature Engineering, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Python, Scikit-learn, Data Visualization
